# Backend API (Coming Soon)

This folder is reserved for the backend API implementation.

## Planned Features:
- User authentication with JWT
- Order management system
- Product inventory API
- Payment integration (Razorpay)
- Database integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

## Tech Stack (Proposed):
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API

Currently, the frontend uses LocalStorage for demo purposes. The backend will replace this with a proper database and API.
